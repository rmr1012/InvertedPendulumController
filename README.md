Self-balancing Robot Controller

Designed to solve a inverted pedulum linear control problem
Implemented with a lead-lag compensator

Models are created in continious time in matlab and simulated, then ported over to discrete time using Tustin's Method. 
Implemented in C, leveraging Professor Bewley's robot control libiary for hardware access
